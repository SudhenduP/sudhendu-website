**What does including your Pronoun in your signature do?**

1.  Removes the guess work for someone.
2.  Help other see how you respect yourself and would in-directly respect the other person as well.
3.  Show that you are compassionate and are ready to take a ‘little’ extra effort so as to not upset someone

**What does NOT including your Pronoun in your signature do?**

1.  It would not make you a evil person. :)

### **Wondering what are pronouns anyway..**

**What should you be adding in your signature?**

*   _he/him/his_ (for someone who might identify as male),
*   _she/her/hers_ (for someone who might identify as female),
*   _they/them/their_ (for someone who might not identify strictly as male or female, these pronouns are considered ‘gender neutral’; also used when referring to multiple people).
