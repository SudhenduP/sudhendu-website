### Telsa is more than Elon Musk.

#### Here are few guys who made it happen, in a way.

Tesla Motors is one of the startup which is solving a hard problem : self-driving electric cars. And somehow, it seems Musk is equal to Tesla. It’s kind-of Yin-Yen of tech industry. Somehow Musk has become an indispensable face of tesla, self driving and electric car. We know that only as true as marketing goes. He, like everyone else, is standing over the shoulders of other giants.

> The problem with such portrayals is not merely that they are inaccurate and unfair to the many contributors to new technologies. By warping the popular understanding of how technologies develop, great-man myths threaten to undermine the structure that is actually necessary for future innovations. — [Amanda Schaffer](http://www.technologyreview.com/contributor/amanda-schaffer/)

If you say, ‘_this is how great men should be_’, that indirectly implies that _if you are not like them_, _you ain’t gonna be any better_.. This leaves zero incentive to try out something else.

On Great Man myth, a good read:

Elon Musk is a revolutionary guy, no doubt (at all). He is one of the pioneer in Silicon Valley (the Paypal guy).

**N**ewton once said, ‘ If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants**’. T**here are many giants out there who probably played equal, less or sometimes more important role in making Tesla Motor happen. And ironically, hardly anybody outside the SV or Venture Capitalist circle knows about them.

This post is about the others. In no particular order.
