I don’t think you understand his point. He is NOT saying, ‘ all dissent would be impossible because all dissenters would have to live autonomously from the society they wished to change.’ His point is, don’t be hypocrite. Simple.

He wanted Sontag to live in hut, grow vegetable, use barter system, etc. because she despised the very mechanism which creates that. Sontag was a special example. Because she despised the very mechanism of market system.

The message is, if you can’t practice what you preach, shut-up.

If I tell my younger brother not to litter, yet I litter everywhere I go, I am a hypocrite and my brother will see through it. Sooner or later.
