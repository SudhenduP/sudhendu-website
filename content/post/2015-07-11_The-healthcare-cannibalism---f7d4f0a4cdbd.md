How Indian Healthcare is eating itself .

![Slowly, reaching the end viz. the start.](img\1__EB5fn3JhRcecfmokXwe9aQ.jpeg)
Slowly, reaching the end viz. the start.

There are few moments in your life when you feel liberated and yet equally choked out . You feel this is the best thing that could happen, yet cry to see the way it is turning up . You feel, this is what I wanted, but not how I wanted.

That’s the exact same feeling I have sitting besides my grandmother. She is hospitalized from, I don’t know, ages. She is suffering from too many problems, health is one of it. While I sit here, I see her resting, totally uncomfortable, yet somehow happy about it.

I could count the number of flies humming around her. It’s 3 now.

She is admitted to into a government funded hospital. Government funded hospitals are backbone of India’s healthcare picture. So much so that in India, you either die at Ayodhya (Hindu holy place) or at some government hospital.

The hospitals in Indian healthcare context can be classified into two types. **The best and the worst** . Alternatively ,the costliest and the cheapest. You either eat Biryani or you have to manage with bread. Private hospitals have bills _10 times_ the daily minimum wage people earn. Government hospitals, almost free. OK, nothing is free. The services they offer you is worse. Sometime I feel, why do people come here at all. The way you are treated is comparable to Nazi’s detection camp.

The issue here a misunderstanding between the patients and the healthcare providers. It is this:

> The coupling (tightly) between services and the treatment provide by the hospital.

When a person enters a government funded hospital, he is expecting economical treatment. Period. That’s it. But somehow the equation gets twisted and it becomes: **_I am coming here because I don’t have any fucking money and thus you can handle me the worst possible way, and I have no say in it._**

The hospitals have the worst of infrastructure you could imagine. No fans, no proper lighting, poor conditioned beds (some worst enough not to be sold on OLX), (very) unhygienic surrounding, dirty waters, utensils having a layer of dirt on it, no professionally trained helpers, medical students making stupids mistake with ‘live’ patients, doctors/nurse having no schedule whatsoever. I can go on.

The point here is the poor condition Indian healthcare industry is in. The best are getting costlier, the worst are getting worse. Somebody has to do something about it. **There has to be a way in which patient experience can be bettered without increasing the cost.** Isn’t there?

This is a big problem. At the same time it becomes a great opporunity. I see thousands of startup blooming out these days. Few are selling online tomatoes, few are showing nearest discounts. I don’t have issues with that but can someone solve some real world problem, please?
