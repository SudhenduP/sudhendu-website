#### The interesting part :
<div style="text-align: justify">
I started my career with TIBCO. I stayed with them for around three years, where I got extensive experience with various TIBCO Products.
I moved to Deloitte after that, planning to learn something other than TIBCO. Lucky for me, I had the opportunity to get my hands dirty with AWS and Dell Boomi.
After three years with Deloitte, BCT TIBCO was my next destination. I work at their Dubai office. Amazing city!

I keep a deep interest in complex technological problems, mostly related to intelligence and human cognition.

I am a self-thought Python programmer, and I create small utilities using Python to help me in day-to-day work! 
Big fan of Python.
